# Reflaxe/GDScript Sample Project
A sample project created with Reflaxe/GDScript and Godot.

# How to Run
* Install Reflaxe/GDScript: `haxelib install gdscript`.
* Run the binding generation script in the `src/` folder: `haxelib run gdscript`.
* Run `haxe compile.hxml` in the top directory to generate the GDScript source code!

Once you're ready, simply open the Godot project in `godot_project/` and run the game!
